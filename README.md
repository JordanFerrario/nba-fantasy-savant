# NBA Fantasy Helper App (working title)

## Concept
You're a fantasy basketball player looking for a better tool to track NBA statistics for the players on your team. You like visual representation of data because it is easier to read than raw numbers and want to be able to follow statistical trends for players throughout the course of the season. 

## User Story
WHEN a user opens the application THEN they will see a login/sign up page displayed on their screen. WHEN a user clicks on the login/sign up button THEN they will be prompted to either log in with their existing credentials or sign up to make a new account. WHEN the user has logged into their account THEN they will see a search bar above their fantasy roster with the up-to-date, 9-category statistics of each player for the current NBA season. WHEN a user clicks on the search bar THEN they are able to input a player's name or filter through the options to see his stats. WHEN a user wants to add a new player to their roster THEN he/she clicks on the plus (+) button next to the player's name and statistics in order to add him to their roster. WHEN a user clicks on the minus button (-) to drop a player from their roster THEN that player is removed from the roster. WHEN a user clicks on a player THEN they are taken to a page with a graphical breakdown of that player's statistical performance.
